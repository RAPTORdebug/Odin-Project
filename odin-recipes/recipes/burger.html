   <p>This recipe walks you through making classic homemade burgers from scratch, including how to cook the perfect patty and build your burger just the way you like it.</p>
 
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>1 lb (450g) ground beef (80% lean)</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>4 burger buns</li>
    <li>4 slices of cheese (optional)</li>
    <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
    <li>Tomato slices</li>
    <li>Onion slices (red or white)</li>
    <li>Pickles (optional)</li>
    <li>Ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise (as desired)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil or butter (for toasting buns)</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Instructions</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions and gently shape into patties, about ¾ inch thick. Don’t overwork the meat.</li>
    <li>Season both sides of each patty with salt and pepper just before cooking.</li>
    <li>Preheat a skillet or grill over medium-high heat. Lightly oil the surface if using a skillet.</li>
    <li>Cook the patties for about 3–4 minutes per side, or until they reach your preferred level of doneness. Add cheese during the last minute if desired, and cover to melt.</li>
    <li>While the burgers cook, toast the buns cut-side-down in a pan or on the grill for 1–2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
    <li>Assemble the burgers: place the patty on the bottom bun, then add lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and condiments of your choice. Top with the other half of the bun.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade burgers!</li>
