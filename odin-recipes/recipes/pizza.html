    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 packet (2 ¼ tsp) active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 cup warm water (about 110°F / 45°C)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>½ cup pizza sauce (store-bought or homemade)</li>
      <li>1 to 1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>Your choice of toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, etc.)</li>
      <li>Fresh basil or oregano (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water. Sprinkle the yeast on top and let it sit for 5–10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
      <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8–10 minutes, until smooth and elastic.</li>
      <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a clean towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1–1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
      <li>Punch down the dough and roll it out into your desired shape on a floured surface.</li>
      <li>Transfer the dough to a baking sheet or pizza peel. Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the crust.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly on top, then add your favorite toppings.</li>
      <li>Bake for 12–15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
      <li>Remove from the oven, let cool for a few minutes, then slice and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
